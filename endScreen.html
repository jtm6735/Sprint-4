    <h1>Plastic</h1>
    <p>Scientific Name: Polyethylene</p>
    <p>Depth: 0 - 36,200 feet</p>
    <p>Although plastic may be useful in our everyday lives, it is harming even the most remote of ecosystems.</p>

    <p>A study from October 2018 documented a plastic bag in the deepest part of the Mariana Trench, which is about 36,000 feet deep. Here, plastic was the most prevalent form of debris in this area. 89% of the plastic found in the trench was single use plastic– plastic that is only used once before being thrown away, like water bottles or utensils.</p>

    <h1>Bluntnose Sixgill Shark</h1>
    <p>Scientific Name: Hexanchus griseus</p>
    <p>Depth: 590 - 8,202 feet</p>
    <p>The bluntnose shark can be found in numerous tropical waters such as the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific oceans. Known for it's largo body and long tail, this deep-sea shark has six rows of saw-like teeth on both it's upper and lower jaw. Its skin color ranges from shades of brown to black, and its snout is blunt and wide.</p>
    <p>Although sluggish in nature, bluntnoses are capable of attaining high speeds when necessary to catch its prey. Fish, rays, squid, crabs, ships, seals, and even other sharks could serve as a tasty snack for this deep sea dweller.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="text">
    <h1>Coelacanth</h1>
    <p>Scientific Name: Latimeria chalumnae</p>
    <p>Depth: 300 - 2,300 feet</p>
    <p>The coelacanth is the one of the oldest species of fish in the world. It is so old that people used to think it had been extinct 65 million years ago, until a fisherman caught one in 1938. There have been regular sightings since then, but they are still considered an endangered species.</p>

    <p>Ceolacanths eat just about anything they can find and fit in their mouth. They possess hinges in their skulls that allow them to consume very large prey, much like other deep sea dwellers. Since food can be scarce at these great depths, scientists believe that the coelacanth has the ability to slow down its metabolism and use less energy. This allows the fish to go for long periods of time without eating. This may be part of the reason they have survived so long and outlived their other prehistoric cousins.</p>

    <h1>Firefly Squid</h1>
    <p>Scientific Name: Watasenia scintillans</p>
    <p>Depth: 300 - 2,300 feet</p>
    <p>This three inch squid is famous for the incredible light show that occurs each year off the coast of Japan as millions of these tiny animals gather to lay their eggs. Once the eggs have been released into the water and fertilized, the adult squid begin to die, which is the end of their one-year life cycle.</p>

    <p>The squid has special light-producing organs called photophores. Thousands of these photophores are found all over their body. The lights can be flashed in unison or alternated in an endless number of animated patterns. These lights can be used to communicate with potential mates or rivals, confuse predators, and attract prey.</p>

    <h1>Sea Toad</h1>
    <p>Scientific Name: Chaunacops</p>
    <p>Depth: 8,070 to 10,816 feet</p>
    <p>Found on the continental slops of the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans, these bottom-dwelling fish have large, globose bodies and short, compressed tails. They are covered in small, spiny scales and, at largest, are around 12 inches in length.</p>

    <p>Their dorsal fin ray can be modified into a short bioluminescent lure, which dangles forward in order to entice pray. Loose skin covers their body and open sensory canals line their form. The Sea Toad also has modified fins which resemble legs.</p>

    <h1>Pacific blood star</h1>
    <p>Scientific Name: Henricia leviuscula</p>
    <p>Depth: 1,300 feet</p>
    <p>In the wild, blood stars are a marine species found in the coastal waters of the Pacific Ocean. Their habitat ranges from the Aleutian Islands (west of the Alaskan peninsula) to the waters of central California. They occur from the low tide line and intertidal zones down to approximately 1300 feet deep.</p>

    <p>They eat bacteria and other small particles.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="text">
    <h1>Blobfish</h1>
    <p>Scientific Name: Psychrolutes microporos</p>
    <p>Depth: 2,000 - 4,000 feet</p>
    <p>Blobfish are native to the the waters off Australia and New Zealand, where they bob along the sea floor, scooping up any unsuspecting small creatures that cross their path. They live at average depths of 3,000 feet. Their diet consists of small crustaceans like crabs, sea urchins, and shellfish.</p>

    <p>Although above ground they may look blob-like, underwater, they actually look like round fish. Because of the amount of gravity and pressure put on them at such depths of the ocean, they have evolved flesh that can withstand the forces.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="text">
    <h1>Dumbo Octopus</h1>
    <p>Scientific Name: Grimpoteuthis</p>
    <p>Depth: at least 13,100 feet</p>
    <p>Dumbo octopuses move by slowly flapping their ear-like fins and using their arms to steer. They are predators that eat invertebrates that swim above the sea floor. Dumbo octopuses don’t usually encounter many predators because they live so deep in the sea. When they are hunted, it is usually by tunas, sharks, dolphins, and other marine mammals.</p>

    <p>These octopuses live at such extreme depths that the water is very cold and there is absolutely no sunlight. Because of this, it is very hard for anything to live there. This is why they have evolved special behaviors to make it more likely for their offspring to survive. The females are able to decide when the eggs will be fertilized by holding the sperm as well as eggs at different stages of developments.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="text">
    <h1>Anglerfish</h1>
    <p>Scientific Name: Lophiiformes</p>
    <p>Depth: 2,500-3,500 Feet</p>
    <p>The light hanging from the front of the female anglerfish’s forhead is a part of their spine that evolved to protrude out like a lure for prey. The light attracts prey by tricking them to think it is food, allowing the anglerfish to get close enough to snatch it. Their mouths are so big, they can actually swallow prey up to twice their own size.</p>

    <p>Male anglerfish have evolved to attach to a female like a parasite. After he attaches himself, he eventually fuses to her, becoming a part of her. His bloodstream becomes a part of hers and he loses his eyes and most of its organs. Often times, a female has more than five males attached to her at once!</p>
